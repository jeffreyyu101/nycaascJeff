1,11:45 - 1:10,1,GC 275,"1 - Orienting Complacency: Racial Hierarchies, Anti-Blackness and White Supremacy in Asian American Communities and History","How do we envision ourselves at the crossroads of identity: Of color? Queer? Immigrant? Asian? American? What does it mean to go from ""Foreign"" to ""Asian-American""? How do we reckon with this identity in the face of a history of our histories with complacence and perpetuation of anti blackness? Please join Yellow Jackets Collective in a discussion and workshop on histories of racial hierarchy and intra/intercommunal violence. Here we will be exploring the ways in which Asian American ""Inclusion"" and ""Assimilation"" has historically (and continues) to work in relation to the continued oppression of Black and indigenous communities. We will be discussing methods of accountability and reviewing shared histories.",Yellow Jackets Collective,"YJC is an intersectional collective of queer Yellow American femmes collaborating towards futures that center marginalized bodies.We say Queer because we identify as queer. We refuse to invest in a future that privileges a binary system of classifications meant to contain and reduce the voluptuousness of identities that exist. We say Intersectional because we believe that no person is free unless we are all free. This means that when we talk about race we talk about gender and class and geopolitics and privilege and sexuality and everything else. We focus on relational values and solidarity/affinity work because we refuse to assume that truth or productivity are ever absolute/unquestionable rather than socially constructed. We say Yellow because we will not contribute to the erasure of those in the Asian diaspora that are not East Asian. We can only claim to speak for and represent our specific experiences as yellow femmes who grew up in white spaces in the US. The rest of the work for us is collaborative and affinity based, because our brown/non-yellow/non-US Asian fams, as well as the rest of our POC/queer fam, speak for themselves. We say Collaborative because yellowness must support and speak on oppressions outside of our own, without taking credit for or leading in spaces that were created by and for specific identities other than our own. Especially those oppressions we have historically contributed to (antiblackness, transphobia, erasure of other Asian diasporic people, etc.) We need to be there to lift and to cherish and to receive similar gifts in return, but never to erase or takeover or silence. We say Radical Futures because we use our creative powers to contribute to the construction of a future with POC/queers at the imaginative core. A radical future is only radical if POC/queers are the ones constructing it. We are tired of investing in anything other than a future that we will thrive in, that we are at the center of, that exists for our growth and love and pleasure. We say Yellow again because at our most powerful we are a YELLOW PERIL and those who oppress us should be afraid. We are watching you. We are making moves."
1,11:45 - 1:10,1,GC 274,2 - My Name Is...,"Words have power, and names more so. Personally, growing up as an Asian American without an ""Americanized"" name, I was subject to jokes about my name. These jokes were not necessarily cruel in nature, but for a good amount of time, I think I resented my own name, although eventually, I grew to appreciate and love my name. Through this workshop, I wish to open a discussion of the power of names; what our (as in the APIA community) names mean to us, especially for those of us with non-Americanized first names; and to explore the themes of identity and names through the experiences we, as Asian Americans have, as many of us live with 'Asian' names, whether it is our given name, a middle name, or our last name.",Eurie Kim,"My name is Eurie Kim, and I'm a current senior at Rutgers University studying Computer Science.

1,11:45 - 1:10,4,C 95,"3 - Discovering Our Voices: Storytelling, Literature, and Writing","Often times, it is difficult to tiptoe the line between exploring our cultural roots and finding our own individuality as Asian Americans through writing. We exist in an in-between of stereotypes and expectations -- an amalgamation of cultural influences from our heritage and upbringing. Mainstream Asian American literature (such as The Joy Luck Club and The Woman Warrior) is often criticized for their authenticity or lack thereof -- does this affect our own writing and how so? This workshop will explore the process of finding our unique selves through writing while still recalling and drawing upon our cultural roots. ",Ed Lin,"Ed Lin is a native New Yorker of Taiwanese and Chinese descent. He is the first author to win three Asian American Literary Awards.

1,11:45 - 1:10,1,GC 265,4 - Curatorial Research and Process,"A case-study examining the exhibition FOLD: Golden Venture Paper Sculptures organized by the Museum of Chinese in America. The popular perception is that history museums are only concerned with the past, but how can a history museum make historical materials relevant today, and what are the limits of interpreting artwork when used to discuss present day societal issues?

1,11:45 - 1:10,1,GC 261,5 - Critical Nostalgia: Negotiating Heritage for Asian artists in the North American Diaspora,"Often caught between the white gaze of the art world and our own self-romanticizing pitfalls, visual artists have used critical histories to help dismantle stereotypes of exoticism and Orientalism. At the same time, there are aspects of our identity that could become complicit to settler-colonialism and other forms of oppression if left unspoken. This workshop explores the nuances of dis/empowerment when it comes to denying or including visual elements of our heritage in artwork. It shows the ways in which Asian artists from the diaspora have navigated their identity and its presentation through a critical nostalgia.",Florence Yee,"Florence Yee is a 2.5-generation, Canto-struggling visual artist based in Montreal/Tiotia:ke.

Created by a team of Filipino-Americans and Filipinos (and a couple of allies), the game is meant to elevate and showcase Filipino-American narratives not only to a primarily Western audience, but also to empower and encourage other members of the Filipino diaspora to speak up and speak proud. Cultural, institutional, and systematic racism has historically downplayed the the importance of AAPI representation. The lack of Asian and Asian-American visibility is the consequence of these biases. This workshop will explore portrayals of Filipinos and Filipino-Americans in the arts and media. Members of the TGWS team will share their personal experiences of expressing Filipino culture through gaming, dance, writing, and other forms of media. We will help participants brainstorm ideas on how they can voice their own cultural narratives with basic online and creative tools.

Where did the fetishization and objectification of Asian women come from? How did Asian women get the hypersexualized stereotypes of being docile and submissive or dangerous and seductive?
