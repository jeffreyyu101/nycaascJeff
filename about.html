                <h3>What is NYCAASC?</h3>
                <p>
                  NYCAASC (pronounced NIGH-sack) is an organization dedicated to bringing students from all throughout New York City together to educate and encourage them to think critically about Asian/Pacific Islander American issues such as gentrification, diversity in media, and more. We hope to empower APIA students to enact change within their respective communities in lasting and meaningful ways.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    We started our annual conference as a safe space for students of all backgrounds and identities to learn about and discuss APIA issues. Through a jam-packed program of engaging speakers, interactive workshops, and moving performances, we hope that students leave our conference with a clearer understanding of their own identities, a greater sense of community, and a drive to build a better and more inclusive Asian America.

                <h3>NYCAASC Today</h3>
                <p>
                    From our inception to today, our goal has always been to inspire and empower youth passionate about APIA issues to create meaningful impacts in their own communities. Over 400 students of all backgrounds from colleges, universities, high schools, and organizations all over the East Coast attended NYCAASC last year alone.

                <h3>The Conference</h3>
                <p>
                    Every year, we host a variety of interactive, educational workshops and panels concerning APIA issues in addition to performances highlighting various up-and-coming Asian American artists. In the past, our conference has featured some really rad performers including MCJin, Awkwafina, Bea Go, Joseph Vincent, and Hari Kondabolu.
